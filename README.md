# C Process Signals: OS Exercises in C, Concurrency and Data

Overview
- These exercises were done as part of the Operating Systems course during my bachelor studies in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania.
- The work explores core OS ideas through C programs. It focuses on processes, signals, synchronization, and inter-process communication.
- The set includes practical demonstrations of how processes interact, how signals are delivered and handled, and how to coordinate work using concurrency primitives.
- The repository aligns with topics in algorithms, C programming, concurrent programming, data structures, debugging, English-language documentation, Git, GitHub, imperative programming, Markdown, and project management.

What you will learn
- How to create and manage processes in Linux using C.
- How signals work at the OS level and how to handle them safely in user space.
- How to synchronize work across processes and threads.
- How to implement data structures that support OS-style tasks, such as queues and linked lists.
- How to debug and reason about concurrent code with clear, well-documented examples.
- How to write clear English documentation for technical projects.
- How to manage a project using Git and GitHub workflows.

Repository topics
- algorithms, c, concurrent-programming, data-structures, debugging, english-language, git, github, imperative-programming, markdown, project-management

Quick start
- Prerequisites: a Linux environment, GCC or Clang, and Make.
- Step 1: Get the code. Open a terminal and clone the repository or download the archive from the Releases page.
- Step 2: Build. Use the provided build system if present, otherwise compile the sources with a standard C compiler.
- Step 3: Run. Execute the programs with their required arguments to observe process creation, signaling, and synchronization in action.
- Step 4: Explore. Read the documentation in the repository to understand how each example works and what it demonstrates about OS behavior.

How to run locally
Prerequisites
- A modern Linux system with POSIX APIs.
- GCC (version 9 or newer recommended) or Clang.
- Make (optional if you use a direct compiler command).
- A standard C library with pthreads support.

Build and run options
- If a Makefile exists, simply run:
  - make
  - make test (if tests are provided)
  - make clean
- If there is no Makefile, compile individual sources with a typical command, for example:
  - gcc -Wall -Wextra -pthread -o program src/program.c
  - ./program
- Some examples require linking with math or other libraries; adjust linker flags as needed:
  - gcc -Wall -Wextra -pthread -lm -o program src/main.c

Running examples
- Each example demonstrates a specific OS concept. Typical usage looks like:
  - ./program [ARGS]
- Common arguments include:
  - --init: initialize resources
  - --run: start the demonstration
  - --signal SIGINT: specify how the program should respond to a signal
- Outputs show process IDs, signal delivery, and synchronization events, giving a concrete view of OS internals.

Program and module overview
- Process creation and lifecycle: Demonstrations of fork(), exec(), and wait() semantics, including how a parent and child interact.
- Signal handling: Plain handlers, blocking signals, and the effect of signals on process groups and sessions.
- Inter-process communication (IPC): Pipes, named pipes (FIFOs), and simple shared data exchanges to illustrate data flow between processes.
- Concurrency primitives: Pthreads where used, including mutexes, condition variables, and barrier-like coordination.
- Data structures: Implementations of dynamic arrays, singly and doubly linked lists, and simple queues to manage tasks and messages.
- Debugging aids: Built-in logging, assertions, and hooks to enable easier tracing of events during runs.
- Documentation quality: All code is documented in clear English with inline comments and external docs that explain the design choices.

Algorithms and data structures
- Sorting and searching within small data sets to illustrate typical algorithmic thinking in OS tasks.
- Queue management for task scheduling and message passing.
- Linked lists used to maintain dynamic process tables or resource trackers.
- Simple hash-like collections for quick lookups in demonstrations that simulate resource tracking.

Concurrency and signals
- Signals as asynchronous events: how signals interrupt execution and what it takes to handle them safely.
- Signal-safe programming practices: minimal work inside signal handlers, deferring heavy processing to main loops.
- Race condition awareness: examples show how improper synchronization can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
- Process coordination: parent-child collaboration, shared resource access, and synchronized termination.

Debugging and testing
- Command-line tracing: how to observe process creation, signal delivery, and inter-process communication.
- Debugging tools: gdb for stepping through code, strace for tracing system calls, and valgrind for memory checks.
- Test strategies: small, deterministic tests that verify behavior for common scenarios and edge cases.
- Reproducibility: instructions to reproduce a failing case by controlling timing with sleeps or deliberate delays.

Documentation and style
- Documentation aims for clarity and accessibility. The English used is precise and straightforward.
- Inline comments explain why decisions were made, not just what the code does.
- Public interfaces are documented with input, output, and expected behavior.
- Code style follows a consistent pattern for readability, with simple constructs and minimal complexity.

Development workflow
- Branching: work on features or experiments in separate branches and merge after review.
- Commits: small, focused commits that explain the change and its intent.
- Reviews: seek feedback on design decisions, edge cases, and potential pitfalls.
- CI: where available, run automated tests to verify correctness and stability across changes.

Contributing
- You can contribute by adding new exercises, improving documentation, and refining the examples.
- Start by opening an issue to discuss a feature or fix. Then create a branch for your work and a pull request with a concise description.
- Follow the projectâ€™s style guide for C code, add tests for new features, and document any new behavior clearly.

Code style and conventions
- Use clear, direct language in documentation and comments.
- Favor explicit over implicit behavior. Name functions and variables clearly.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use defensive checks for pointers and system calls.
- Prefer simple data structures for clarity unless a complex structure is necessary.
